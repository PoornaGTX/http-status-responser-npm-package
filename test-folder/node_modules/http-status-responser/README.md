# http-status-responser

The "http-status-responser" package is an npm package that provides a simple way to access all the HTTP response code constants values. This package defines a set of constants that represent the different HTTP status codes that can be returned by a server in response to a client request, such as 200 for "OK", 404 for "NOT_FOUND", and 500 for "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR". By using this package,
developers can easily reference these constants in their code instead of hardcoding the status codes, which can help to make the code more readable and maintainable.

## Installation

Install http-status-codes with npm

```bash
  npm i http-status-responser
```

## Usage/Examples

```javascript
import httpStatusResponser from "http-status-responser";

const login = async (req, res) => {
    //body
    res.status(httpStatusResponser.OK).json({ user });
}
